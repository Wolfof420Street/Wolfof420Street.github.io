    <p> About Me <p>
    <p> I am a young enthusiastic and energetic man interested in technology as
      a whole. I could have deviated into the hardware perspective but I was
      really intrigued by the software aspect. After I cleared highschool, I got
      my CCNA certification as a network specialist. I then pursued a degree
      in computer technology from JKUAT. </p>
