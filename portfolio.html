    <p> About Me </p>
    <p> I am a young enthusiastic and energetic man interested in technology as
      a whole. I could have deviated into the hardware perspective but I was
      really intrigued by the software aspect. After I cleared highschool, I got
      my CCNA certification as a network specialist. I then pursued a degree
      in computer technology from JKUAT. </p>
      <p> My hobbies include: <p>
        <ol>
          <li> reading crime novels </li>
          <li> watching sci-fi movies </li>
          <li> watching documentaries </li>
          <li> hiking </li>
        </ol>

    <p> On my journey to coding I have come up with some few projects: </p>
    <p> I did a sample resort website <a href="https://github.com/Wolfof420Street/Wolf" </a>
      for a resort as part of my school project. The website has various pages
      that highlight the service that the resort offers like accomodation and
      travel. I used HTML to write and added style using CSS </p>
